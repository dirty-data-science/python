========================================================
Dirty categories: learning with non normalized strings
========================================================

Including strings that represent categories often calls for much data
preparation. In particular categories may appear with many morphological
variants, when they have been manually input, or assembled from diverse
sources.

Including such a column in a learning pipeline as a standard categorical
colum leads to categories with very high cardinalities and can lose
information on which categories are similar.

Here we look at a dataset on wages [#]_ where the column *Employee
Position Title* contains dirty categories.

.. [#] https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/employee-salaries-2016

We investigate encodings to include such compare different categorical
encodings for the dirty column to predict the *Current Annual Salary*,
using gradient boosted trees. For this purpose, we use the skrub
library ( https://skrub-data.org ).

Data Importing and preprocessing
--------------------------------

We first download the dataset:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-58

.. code-block:: Python

    from skrub.datasets import fetch_employee_salaries
    employee_salaries = fetch_employee_salaries()
    print(employee_salaries.description)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Annual salary information including gross pay and overtime pay for all active, permanent employees of Montgomery County, MD paid in calendar year 2016. This information will be published annually each year.




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-60

Then we load it:

Inspecting the features created
.................................

The |SV| assigns a transformer for each column. We can inspect this
choice:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 176-178

.. code-block:: Python

    tab_vec.transformers_





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none


    {'year_first_hired': PassThrough(), 'date_first_hired': DatetimeEncoder(), 'gender': OneHotEncoder(drop='if_binary', dtype='float32', handle_unknown='ignore',
                  sparse_output=False), 'department': OneHotEncoder(drop='if_binary', dtype='float32', handle_unknown='ignore',
                  sparse_output=False), 'department_name': OneHotEncoder(drop='if_binary', dtype='float32', handle_unknown='ignore',
                  sparse_output=False), 'assignment_category': OneHotEncoder(drop='if_binary', dtype='float32', handle_unknown='ignore',
                  sparse_output=False), 'division': GapEncoder(n_components=30), 'employee_position_title': GapEncoder(n_components=30)}



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 179-191

This is what is being passed to transform the different columns under the hood.
We can notice it classified the columns "gender" and "assignment_category"
as low cardinality string variables.
A |OneHotEncoder| will be applied to these columns.

The vectorizer actually makes the difference between string variables
(data type ``object`` and ``string``) and categorical variables
(data type ``category``).

Next, we can have a look at the encoded feature names.

Before encoding:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 191-193

.. code-block:: Python

    X.columns.to_list()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none


    ['gender', 'department', 'department_name', 'division', 'assignment_category', 'employee_position_title', 'date_first_hired', 'year_first_hired']



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 194-195

After encoding (we only plot the first 8 feature names):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 195-198

.. code-block:: Python

    feature_names = tab_vec.get_feature_names_out()
    feature_names[:8]





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none


    array(['gender_F', 'gender_M', 'gender_nan', 'department_BOA',
           'department_BOE', 'department_CAT', 'department_CCL',
           'department_CEC'], dtype='<U70')



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 199-205

As we can see, it created a new column for each unique value.
This is because we used |SE| on the column "division",
which was classified as a high cardinality string variable.
(default values, see |SV|'s docstring).

In total, we have reasonnable number of encoded columns.

Feature importance in the statistical model
---------------------------------------------

In this section, we will train a regressor, and plot the feature importances

.. topic:: Note:

   To minimize compute time, use the feature importances computed by the
   |RandomForestRegressor|, but you should prefer |permutation importances|
   instead (which are less subject to biases)

First, let's train the |RandomForestRegressor|,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 221-227

    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    regressor = RandomForestRegressor()
    regressor.fit(X_train_enc, y_train)

Exploring different machine-learning pipeline to encode the data
=================================================================

The learning pipeline
----------------------------

To build a learning pipeline, we need to assemble encoders for each
column, and apply a supervised learning model on top.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 271-276

Encoding the table
........................

The TableVectorizer applies different transformations to the different
columns to turn them into numerical values suitable for learning

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 276-280

.. code-block:: Python


    from skrub import TableVectorizer
    encoder = TableVectorizer()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 281-285

Pipelining an encoder with a learner
....................................

Here again we use a pipeline with HistGradientBoostingRegressor

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 285-288

.. code-block:: Python

    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingRegressor
    pipeline = make_pipeline(encoder, HistGradientBoostingRegressor())








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 289-290

The pipeline can be readily applied to the dataframe for prediction

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 290-301

.. code-block:: Python

    pipeline.fit(df, y)

    # The categorical encoders
    # ........................
    #
    # A encoder is needed to turn a categorical column into a numerical
    # representation
    from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

    one_hot = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 302-309

Dirty-category encoding
-------------------------

The one-hot encoder is actually not well suited to the 'Employee
Position Title' column, as this columns contains 400 different entries.

We will now experiments with different encoders for dirty columns

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 309-325

.. code-block:: Python

    from skrub import SimilarityEncoder, MinHashEncoder,\
        GapEncoder
    #TargetEncoder, 

    similarity = SimilarityEncoder()
    #target = TargetEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')
    minhash = MinHashEncoder(n_components=100)
    gap = GapEncoder(n_components=100)

    encoders = {
        'one-hot': one_hot,
        'similarity': similarity,
        #'target': target,
        'minhash': minhash,
        'gap': gap}








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 326-329

We now loop over the different encoding methods,
instantiate each time a new pipeline, fit it
and store the returned cross-validation score:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 329-342

.. code-block:: Python


    all_scores = dict()

    for name, method in encoders.items():
        encoder = TableVectorizer(high_cardinality=method)

        pipeline = make_pipeline(encoder, HistGradientBoostingRegressor())
        scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, df, y)
        print('{} encoding'.format(name))
        print('r2 score:  mean: {:.3f}; std: {:.3f}\n'.format(
            np.mean(scores), np.std(scores)))
        all_scores[name] = scores





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    minhash encoding
    r2 score:  mean: 0.924; std: 0.012

    gap encoding
    r2 score:  mean: 0.932; std: 0.009

Plotting the results
.....................
Finally, we plot the scores on a boxplot:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 346-356

.. code-block:: Python


    import seaborn
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))
    ax = seaborn.boxplot(data=pd.DataFrame(all_scores), orient='h')
    plt.ylabel('Encoding', size=20)
    plt.xlabel('Prediction accuracy     ', size=20)
    plt.yticks(size=20)
    plt.tight_layout()

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 357-368

The clear trend is that encoders that use the string form
of the category (similarity, minhash, and gap) perform better than
those that discard it.

SimilarityEncoder is the best performer, but it is less scalable on big
data than MinHashEncoder and GapEncoder. The most scalable encoder is
the MinHashEncoder. GapEncoder, on the other hand, has the benefit that
it provides interpretable features (see :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_04_feature_interpretation_gap_encoder.py`)
