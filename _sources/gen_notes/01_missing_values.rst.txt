=========================================
Machine learning with missing values
=========================================

Here we use simulated data to understanding the fundamentals of statistical
learning with missing values.

This notebook reveals why a HistGradientBoostingRegressor (
:class:`sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` ) is a good choice to
predict with missing values.

We use simulations to control the missing-value mechanism, and inspect
it's impact on predictive models. In particular, standard imputation
procedures can reconstruct missing values without distortion only if the
data is *missing at random*.

A good introduction to the mathematics behind this notebook can be found in
https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06931

.. topic:: **Missing values in categorical data**

    If a categorical column has missing values, the simplest approach is
    to create a specific category "missing" and assign missing values to
    this new category, to represent missingness in the classifier.
    Indeed, as we will see, imputation is not crucial for prediction.
    In the following we focus on continuous columns, where the discrete
    nature of a missing value poses more problems.

The fully-observed data: a toy regression problem
==================================================

We consider a simple regression problem where X (the data) is bivariate
gaussian, and y (the prediction target)  is a linear function of the first
coordinate, with noise.

Conditional Imputation with the IterativeImputer
------------------------------------------------

As the data is MAR (missing at random), an imputer can use the
conditional dependencies between the observed and the missing values to
impute the missing values.

We'll use the IterativeImputer, a good imputer, but it needs to be enabled

Supervised learning: imputation and a linear model
-----------------------------------------------------------

Given that the relationship between the fully-observed X and y is a
linear relationship, it seems natural to use a linear model for
prediction. It must be adapted to missing values using imputation.

To use it in supervised setting, we will pipeline it with a linear
model, using a ridge, which is a good default linear model

**When there is a reasonnable amout of data, the
HistGradientBoostingRegressor is the best strategy** even for a linear
data-generating mechanism, in MAR settings, which are settings
favorable to imputation + linear model [#]_.

.. [#] Even in the case of a linear data-generating mechanism, the
       optimal prediction one data imputed by a constant
       is a piecewise affine function with 2^d regions (
       http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/morvan20a.html ). The
       larger the dimensionality (number of features), the more a
       imperfect imputation is hard to approximate with a simple model.

Recovering the initial data distribution would need much more mass on
the right and the top of the figure. The imputed data is shifted to
lower values than the original data.

Note also that as imputed values typically have lower X values than
their full-observed counterparts, the association between X and y is
also distorted. This is visible as the imputed values appear as lighter
diagonal lines.

An important consequence is that **the link between imputed X and y is no
longer linear**, although the original data-generating mechanism is
linear [#]_. For this reason, **it is often a good idea to use non-linear
learners in the presence of missing values**.

.. [#] As mentionned above, even in the case of a linear
   data-generating mechanism, imperfect imputation leads to complex
   functions to link to y (

Here there is information in missingness (if a value is missing, it is
large), information that a model can use to predict better.

Applying a model valid on the full data to imputed data work almost
as well as a model trained for missing values. The small loss in
performance is because the imputation is imperfect.

When the data-generation is non linear
---------------------------------------

We now modify a bit the example above to consider the situation where y
is a non-linear function of X

Once again, we have a near-perfect predictor on fully-observed data

On data with missing values:

The full-data predictor works much less well

Now we use a model trained to predict on data with missing values

The model trained on data with missing values works significantly
better than that was optimal for the fully-observed data.

**Only for linear mechanism is the model on full data also optimal for
perfectly imputed data**. When the function linking X to y has
curvature, this curvature turns uncertainty resulting from missingness
into bias [#]_.

   imputation can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00311
